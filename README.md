# dog-image-generation
GAN dog image generation from the [kaggle competion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/generative-dog-images).

## Purpose
These are mainly my own motivators for doing this project.

- Learn about GAN networks.
- Experiment with Tensorflow 2.0.

## Data
- [Stanford Dog Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/)
